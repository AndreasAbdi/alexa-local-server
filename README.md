# Description

## Instructions

1. [Install the Alexa CLI.](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html)

2. modify the .serverconf.json.template with appropriate config values.

    - AlexaAppID is autogenerated by the deploy.sh script. Don't need to mess with it.
    - ServerAddress is the port where the server should listen on.
    - The IRFunctionality is based on an [ir blaster arduino endpoint.](https://github.com/mdhiggins/ESP8266-HTTP-IR-Blaster/). Not really mandatory to input.
    - Google Key is the google API key with the values to access youtube api. (Youtube Data API V3)

3. Run `./deploy.sh`

4. Tell alexa to do things like

    - `alexa, tell local server to play summertime sadness`
    - `alexa, tell local server to pause`
    - `alexa, tell local server i'm home`
